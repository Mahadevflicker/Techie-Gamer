Hi
The project is to build a 2D mobile game to implement the concept of XNA framework profiles. 
The game is designed using Adobe Photoshop and it is targeted to the platform Windows Phone 7.
I have uploaded the images i worked and I have uploaded only sample codes.

Feel free to ask me any queries regarding the work.

Thank you

Mahadev
